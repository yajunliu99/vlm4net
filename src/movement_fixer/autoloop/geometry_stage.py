{checks}
Changes already made in earlier rounds, described by position because IDs are renumbered left to right every round (this round's e2 or r2 need not be what an earlier round called e2 or r2). Those changes are already in the geometry shown; do not repeat or undo one without new visible evidence:
{earlier}
Answer every check key once: "edit" and include the edit; "dismiss" when the geometry is right as drawn, saying what in the pixels shows it (a bicycle strip is legitimately narrow, a bay legitimately tapers); or "unresolved" when this image cannot settle it.
You may also correct boundaries no check mentioned. Change only what the pixels support. Shadow or vehicles hiding a boundary are not evidence that it is absent: where a boundary cannot be seen either way, answer "unresolved" and leave it rather than merging or dropping. Do not regularise widths and do not aim for a number of lanes; none is given. Edits use crop units, one x per station:
  {{"op":"move_edge","edge":"e2","xs":[...]}}
  {{"op":"split_region","region":"r3","xs":[...]}} for a boundary visible inside r3
  {{"op":"merge_regions","regions":["r3","r4"]}} when no real boundary separates them
  {{"op":"add_region","side":"left|right","xs":[...]}} when the carriageway continues beyond the outer boundary
  {{"op":"drop_region","region":"r1"}} when an outermost region is opposing carriageway or not road
IDs always refer to the geometry shown in this round, even when several edits are returned. Every edit needs "evidence".
