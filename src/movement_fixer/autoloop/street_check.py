"""Street-view lane counts held against the traced lanes, and the review issue that sends a mismatch back to tracing.

Classification reports, for each forward street view of an approach, how many motor lanes of that direction cross
the image at the camera and which lanes or regions do not line up (`street_view_counts`). Where the street views
settle on a count that differs from the motor lanes found among the traced regions, the section goes back to the
review loop with that finding as an issue; the reviewer sees the street view with the boundaries projected onto it
and decides whether a boundary is missing, spurious, or right after all (the camera may stand where a pocket has
not opened yet). Counts are model readings, so they prompt a review; they never overwrite the geometry.
