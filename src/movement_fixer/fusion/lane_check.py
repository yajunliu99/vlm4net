"""Blind check of approaches whose VLM lane count differs from a reference (UTDF).

For each such approach the model sees the unmarked satellite crop and the mid and near forward street views,
and reads the lane layout at the stop bar on its own: it is told neither the VLM result nor the reference.
Code then compares its reading with both. The check is recorded beside the run; it never changes the lane
predictions, and the reference is never shown to a model.

Read the lane layout of THIS approach at the stop bar, counting from the driver's left.
- Count only lanes open to general motor traffic in the direction of travel. Turn pockets count; a lane shared with a streetcar counts.
- Do not count opposing lanes, medians, bicycle lanes, rail- or bus-only lanes, parking or shoulders; report those separately.
- For each counted lane give the movements its pavement arrows allow (left, through, right, u_turn), or an empty list if no arrow is legible.
- If shadow, occlusion, image age or camera position prevents a reliable count, set count_settled to false instead of guessing.
