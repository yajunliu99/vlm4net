If GSV is supplied, use its physical layout only after accounting for camera position and direction.

def usage_prompt(direction,lane_evidence,source_metadata,contexts):
    return f"""Infer lane USE from visual evidence for the {direction} incoming approach.
The satellite panel shows candidate regions with travel pointing UP. GSV panels retain original camera orientation and each has its own source ID. No lane-use reference answers or reviewed turn constraints are provided. The supplied surface audit is another model's prediction, not truth.
Reassess the physical surface and facility existence for EVERY candidate using the joint evidence. A satellite-only parking/non-road interpretation can be wrong, especially with stopped cars or shadow; retain it, revise it, or leave uncertain based on explicit GSV-to-satellite landmarks. Do not mechanically propagate the preliminary class. Conversely, a GSV motor lane does not prove that a differently located satellite polygon is the same facility. Report the fused surface type, existence and reasoning separately from lane use.
{KERB_LANE}
For every forward street view, count the lanes of this direction that cross the image at the camera's position, from the centre line or median to the kerb, and say how they line up with the candidate regions: name a lane that has no region of its own, or a region that is not such a lane. Report this in street_view_counts; it is checked against the traced regions later. Keep the region classes consistent with it: a region you find to be opposing traffic, sidewalk, parking or another non-lane gets that class here, not motor_vehicle_lane.
Read arrows, ONLY signs and lane/bike/curb/rail ordering. Explicitly bind any marking to a satellite region using physical anchors. Vehicle heading, lane width and straight alignment alone do not establish permission. A right/left arrow plus an applicable ONLY marking supports dedicated use; unreadability is not absence. Do not assign a curbside sign to a neighboring lane merely because it is nearby in the picture.
Use all supplied distance bands. Trace any splits, turn pockets and bicycle crossings between the far/mid image and the stopbar; retain uncertainty when continuity is not visible. A date difference can be a temporal change, not a spatial transition. Same-panorama crops are not independent confirmations.
Do NOT make an answer match a preferred number of lanes or movements. For every region report your predicted use and the specific evidence binding. If a small sign/arrow could resolve uncertainty, request at most three native-image crops by source_id and normalized bbox. The code will crop those exact pixels once; do not guess text to avoid requesting a crop.
